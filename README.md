# Basic Nessus Vulnerability Scan On Windows 10 Virtual Machine Host

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzUqbjk6TCo)

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, Nessus was used to conduct a vulnerability scan on a Windows 10 virtual machine/host. The purpose of the scan was to identify any security vulnerabilities present on the system, such as outdated software or misconfigured settings, which could be exploited by attackers. The results of the scan were analyzed, and any identified vulnerabilities were prioritized based on their severity and potential impact. Recommendations for addressing the vulnerabilities were then provided. Overall, the lab demonstrated the usefulness of Nessus as a tool for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in Windows 10 systems.

** NOTE ** The Virtual Machine we are using is Vmware with Windows 10 installed and configured. In a later video I will demonstrate on how I created teh virtual machine and installed Windows 10.

We will first start at the VMDR Dashboard: <br/>

<br />
<br />
You would want to then click on Scans -> Appliances -> New -> Virtual Scanner Appliance:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
After clicking on New Virtual Scanner Appliance, you then would want to click on "Start Wizard": <br/>

<br />
<br />
For Virtual Scanner Name we are using "Test-MD", you can put any name. On the "Choose a Virtualization Platform, select VMware Workstation, Workstation Player, Fusion:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/G31l9ve.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
You will then click Next until you get to the page that has a Personalization Code. Write down the code to be on the safe side, as you will need the code later on. Then click on Check Activation :  <br/>

<br />
<br />
This will take a few minutes to process:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
We will then have our VM pull up where we will see confirmation of the appliance. Click on Finish:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/Dy4VsXY.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
As you can see the VM Appliance is Importing:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Once our Virtual Appliance/VM has loaded up **NOTE, the Virtual Scanner can take a bit of time to load**:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/zelOJHe.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
Once the Virtual Scanner has loaded we will get to the Quayls Scanner Console Page:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/kUM3vmS.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
If a pop up for our Virtual Machine mouse keeps pulling up, just click cancel. After a few minutes go by, you should then get to this page where you will see a section to enter your personalization code. Enter the Personalization code from earlier. :  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/2fZApMx.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
Once code is entered, we will then see a message saying "Preparing the scanner personalization. :  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/mak6jGP.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
We need to add asset groups. We do this by going to Select Assets-Asset Group-New. We will then get to this page to enter information about our Group, such as the name and confirmation of the owner:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/pBPab4i.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
We will then enter IPs that we will be conducting a scan on. Here are few generic IPs we can use but of course, its best to use the IP address associated with your devices on your network. We will then go to scanner appliances and drop down see our Virtual Appliance Scanner that we had named previously. Click Save. We will get an error but that is because we will need to add hosts assets.:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/QF6gZMU.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
Click on Host Assets, then click on Add IP to CertView:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/0uf5Rbu.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
Enter the same IP addresses in the Host IP section and then click add and then apply:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/7fZjsi1.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
We will then go back to asset groups, select asset groups, then select new. You will continue entering a name for your group and then under the IP section, "Select Asset Groups". Click on all the boxes of the IP addresses assigned and then click select. You then select the same virtual scanner as before and then click save to finalize:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/H7LTMOZ.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
We will then Add Authentication, by clicking on authentication->New->Operating Systems->Windows->Add Domain and User Credentials. There you will enter title->credentials. Here you can enter admin, password1 as this is just an example. You will then again select the IP addresses entered previously:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/JPeQndk.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
Next we will want to click on scans->scan->new->Give the Name->Select the Profile which you want->Select Our Virtual Scanner Appliance->Select Asset Group and click Launch. On the Launch Vulnerability Scan, we will enter info on the title and import the default settings for profile->Click "Dont Make Global" on the final profile section. Before clicking scan, enter the drop down info for scanner and groups. Click Launch to start scan:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Scans can take from a few minutes to a few hours. Once completed, Scan Status Overview will populate with info on scan. Once the scan is complete, you can then view a report by clicking on reports, new scan report. You can then enter a title of your report and then select the format and template on how you would like to view it:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/cC3YEmu.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
Here we can see details on the scan that will show the severity of our vulnerabilities at which we can then go to patch. I used MS Word to view my report. At a later lab, we will conduct patch management on vulnerabilites:  <br/>
