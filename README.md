# Basic Nessus Vulnerability Scan On Windows 10 Virtual Machine Host

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzUqbjk6TCo)

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, Nessus was used to conduct a vulnerability scan on a Windows 10 virtual machine/host. The purpose of the scan was to identify any security vulnerabilities present on the system, such as outdated software or misconfigured settings, which could be exploited by attackers. The results of the scan were analyzed, and any identified vulnerabilities were prioritized based on their severity and potential impact. Recommendations for addressing the vulnerabilities were then provided. Overall, the lab demonstrated the usefulness of Nessus as a tool for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in Windows 10 systems.

** NOTE ** The Virtual Machine we are using is Vmware with Windows 10 installed and configured. In a later video I will demonstrate on how I created teh virtual machine and installed Windows 10.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Nessus</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)
- <b>VMware Virtual Machine</b>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
First we want to make sure that our firewall settings are configured. Like in our last Nessus scan lab, we disabled Domain, Private and Public profile settings. This ensure that the host will allow the scan to go through on the host.: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Next we will configure some additional settings on the Host. We will do this by first going to services, and enable Remote Registry by selecting Automatic in the drop down.:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now we want to configure Managed Advanced Sharing Settings to make sure that both network sharing and file and printer sharing are turned on. :  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now we will configure User Account Control Settings to "Never Notify". Although this is never
Recommended, it is necessary for our lab. :  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now we will pull up Registry Editor to create the local account token policy. :  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now we will go to our original Nessus non-credentialed scan and configure it to add the credentials of the admin account to make it a credentialed scan.
After configuration, we will start our newly configured credential scan. This will take a bit.:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now that the scan has been completed, we can see that we have more vulnerabilities populating. As you can see, some of the newly found vulnerabilities are critical as it relates to the specific windows host missing a security update. We can also see that there are remediation options available.: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now that we have reviewed our credential scan, we download an older/deprecated version of Firefox onto the Virtual Machine and re-run our credential scan to analyze the vulnerabilities that we find. 
We will do this by going to our Virtual Machine browser and searching for "older fire fox version". In this lab, we downloaded version 3.6.12/win32.
After the installation of the older Fire Fox browser downloaded, we will re-run our scan.:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now with our scan completed, we can see that we now have well over 1600 critical vulnerabilities with the fire fox browser alone. 
By analyzing the critical vulnerabilities, we can see remediation recommendations that are offered through Nessus. Although we can just update the browser, I will just un-install it for this demonstration.:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Heres confirmation of uninstallation of Fire Fox.:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
With Firefox uninstalled on our Virtual Machine. We will now visit our Windows Update settings and run a few updates as our remediation action of the critical vulnerabilities. 
This will take a few minutes as there are countless updates available that require a restart of our Virtual Machine.:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now that we have completed all of our updates, we will now re-run our credentialed scan through Nessus and see that we have eliminated all of the critical vulnerabilities that where flagged with the outdated Firefox browser.:  <br/>
